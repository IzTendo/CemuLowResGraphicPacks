# CemuLowResGraphicPacks
Low resolution graphics packs for users who cannot quite get 60FPS in Cemu, the Nintendo Wii U emulator. 

# Disclaimer
These graphics packs are extremely outdated and are now only useful for users who's GPUs are too old and can't run current version of Cemu. Exmamples of this can be found with Intel GPUs that don't support Vulkan, where these users are held back to Cemu 1.15 or so.
